Wellcome to my repository for Deep Reinforcement Learning Nanodegree at Udacity.

Here I will store the code and the relevant files for the submission of the projects required by this degree. Below you can navigate to the individual projects:

1. [Project 1 - Navigation](Project%201/): a Deep NN model that allows navigation in a simulated environment
2. [Project 2 - Continuous Control](Project%202/): a Deep NN model that allows navigation in a simulated environment
3. [Project 3 - Collaboration and Competition.ipynb](Project%203/): a Deep NN model implementing a Multi Agent DDPG to play tennins in a simulated environment
